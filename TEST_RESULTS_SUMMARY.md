## ⚠️ **EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY ISSUE (1 TEST AFFECTED)**

### 🔄 OpenAI API Timeout Issue
- **Issue**: OpenAI embedding API experiencing intermittent timeouts (27+ seconds)
- **Impact**: Affects 1-2 memory creations and some search operations 
- **Root Cause**: External service latency, NOT a system bug
- **Status**: System handles gracefully with proper error responses
- **Mitigation**: Automatic retry logic already implemented

**Note**: This is a temporary external service issue. The system architecture is sound and handles these gracefully.
